Motivated by the recent developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) as well as a general need for big data analysis in object detection and classification as well as image generation by utilizing learning-based approaches and models such as deep neural networks (DNN), this manuscript aims at providing a consolidated overview of evaluation and performance metrics for machine learning and computer vision (CV). For this purpose, well-established evaluation metrics are presented, for which their (dis-)advantages as well as their origins are emphasized. As this manuscript is meant as a continuously consolidated overview, more evaluation metrics will be added over time.
