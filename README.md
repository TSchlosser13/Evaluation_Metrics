In the rapidly evolving fields of machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV), selecting and applying appropriate evaluation and performance metrics are crucial for advancing and validating innovative models. These metrics not only guide the development and fine-tuning of algorithms but also shape the interpretation of outcomes in diverse applications, such as automated disease diagnosis and autonomous driving. This contribution is motivated by recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), particularly in big data analysis for tasks such as object detection and classification using learning-based approaches, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep neural networks (DNN). We present well-established evaluation metrics, detailing their advantages, disadvantages, and origins. By consolidating current knowledge and providing insights into the effective use of these metrics, this contribution aims to equip researchers and practitioners with the essential tools to critically evaluate and enhance the robustness and reliability of their models.
